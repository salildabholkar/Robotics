# Robotics
Robotics related projects developed by me. I have experience developing high performance programs using C++ as well as using frameworks such as ROS

## Current projects:
* [Path planning on highway with traffic](Path Planning) - Used multi-sensor data fusion to combine data from various car sensor to find optimum lane for car
* Local Path Planning with obstacle avoidance using Bug2 Algorithm - Used ROS along with python
* Combining Global (A*) and Local (Vector Field Histogram) algorithms for robust path planning - Used ROS along with python


## Running these projects

### General Requirements
* python 3
* pip 3

### Clone the project
Clone the project to your local machine using:

    git@github.com:salildabholkar/Robotics.git

### Run the desired project:
Make sure `python 3` is being used by doing `python --version`

The individual project directories may have specific instructions on how to run them
